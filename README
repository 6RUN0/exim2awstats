exim2awstats is a PHP script that can translate the log files from the 
Exim MTA (http://exim.org) into a format that can be used by the log 
analyzer AWStats (http://awstats.sourceforge.net).  AWStats will be able 
to show counts/sizes of mailings, the usual hourly/daily/monthly/yearly 
statistics, the top sender hosts/receiver email addresses/sender email 
addresses, and SMTP errors for those who use the Exim MTA.

Simple modifications to the AWStats template configuration file can 
utilize the script to analyze both successful and failed SMTP 
transactions.  The script also informs the user about log lines that it 
is unable to handle and can optionally e-mail that information back to 
the user.  This can be useful when AWStats' execution is handled in an 
automated fashion (e.g. cron).  Typically, unknown lines will be new 
types of errors that the script does not yet know about.  The logging of 
successful mailings doesn't vary much.  Unknown informational lines 
could also be found but they are unlikely to affect the information that 
AWStats is seeking.  This information about unknown lines can be used to 
update the script in future versions.
